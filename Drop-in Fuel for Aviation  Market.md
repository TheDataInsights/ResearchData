**Market Overview:** The aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, prompting a shift toward sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). Drop-in fuels, a subset of SAFs, have gained traction due to their compatibility with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. They are produced from various feedstocks like municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, and sustainable biomass, leveraging processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and hydroprocessing.

The market has been primarily driven by stringent government regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting the adoption of renewable fuels. Additionally, increased awareness among airlines about the benefits of drop-in fuels, including their potential to lower emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, has fueled market growth. Despite these advancements, challenges related to scalability, production costs, and feedstock availability persist, hindering widespread adoption.
