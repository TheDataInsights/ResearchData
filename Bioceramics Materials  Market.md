mechanical strength, promoting better tissue integration and reducing
the risk of rejection or infection.

Moreover, dental applications contribute significantly to the market's
growth. Bioceramics are extensively used in restorative dentistry for
dental implants, crowns, bridges, and orthodontic brackets. Their
tooth-like appearance, biocompatibility, and durability make them an
attractive choice for dental procedures, driving their adoption among
both patients and practitioners.

The market's expansion is further fueled by ongoing research and
development initiatives. Innovations in nanotechnology, surface
modification techniques, and the development of bioactive ceramics have
widened the scope of bioceramics applications. These advancements aim to
enhance material performance, biocompatibility, and integration with the
human body, fostering their acceptance in diverse medical fields.
