In the food and beverage sector, artificial colors are extensively used
to impart vibrant and appealing hues to a wide array of products,
ranging from candies, soft drinks, and confectioneries to sauces,
snacks, and baked goods. Manufacturers leverage these colorants to
create visually enticing products, making them more attractive and

makeup, hair care products, and toiletries.

However, despite the widespread use and demand, the artificial colors
market faces challenges and regulatory scrutiny. Concerns regarding the
safety and potential health risks associated with certain synthetic
colorants have prompted regulatory bodies across the globe to impose
stringent regulations and guidelines on their usage. This has led to a
growing preference among consumers for natural alternatives perceived as
